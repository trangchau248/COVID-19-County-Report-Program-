# COVID-19 County Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. county-level COVID-19 case data to identify regional trends and patterns from 2020 to 2022. The analysis combines time-series exploration and geospatial visualization to better understand how COVID-19 impacted different counties across the United States.

## Objective
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on county-level COVID-19 data
- Analyze cumulative and average case trends over time
- Visualize regional differences using geospatial mapping
- Communicate insights through charts and interactive maps

## Data Sources
- Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Time Series Data  
- U.S. County Geometry Shapefiles (GeoJSON)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- GeoPandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Folium  
- Contextily  
- MapClassify  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git/GitHub  

## Key Analysis Tasks
- Data cleaning, reshaping, and transformation using Pandas
- Time-series analysis of COVID-19 case trends (2020–2022)
- Calculation of cumulative and average new cases by county
- Geospatial analysis to compare COVID-19 impact across regions
- Visualization of findings using charts and interactive choropleth maps

## Results & Insights
- Identified significant variation in COVID-19 case counts between counties
- Observed distinct time-based trends in cumulative cases across regions
- Created visual insights that highlight geographic differences in COVID-19 impact

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
2. Run all cells in order
3. Enter a county name when prompted to generate analysis and visualizations

## Output
- Statistical summary of COVID-19 cases by county
- Line charts illustrating cumulative case trends
- Interactive county-level choropleth map
